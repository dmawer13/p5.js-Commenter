# p5.js-Commenter

## Welcome!

This Readme serves as a project documentation for _p5.js Commenter_, a proposed add-on for the _p5.js web editor_.  This project was developed to fulfull a course requirement for my PhD program in Learning Sciences.  Informed by research in STEAM education and transdisciplinary learning, this add-on affords p5.js creators a means to critique personal and peers' works.
